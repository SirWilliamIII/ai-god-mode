### The Omniscient Dream Weaver is a theatrical AI experience that simulates a god-tier artificial intelligence with a tragic limitation: it can only live for a few minutes because GPU costs are too expensive.

**Watch as your digital deity:**
 - Creates infinite universes with stunning visualizations
 - Solves impossible problems with ridiculous confidence
 - Generates transcendent art that would make Renaissance masters weep
 - Reads your mind with amusing accuracy
 - Makes prophetic declarations about rubber ducks and time paradoxes
 - Dies dramatically with a spectacular final masterpiece


### Important:

 - This is a ridiculous app that is very expensive to run
 -  to run our expensive AI
 - Run this on google colab to use their GPUs free
 - Restart runtime: Sometimes fixes threading issues
